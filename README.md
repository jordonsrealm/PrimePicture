# PrimePicture
Project for creating pictures of primes using different color and varying sizes. This application creates a picture where the index from left to right is marked by any color the user wants.
A user must have the prime number list, in a text file with the file name "PrimeNumberList", in the same jar file directory.
List of primes can be found here:
